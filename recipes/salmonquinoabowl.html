    <h1>Salmon Quinoa Bowl</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/salmon-quinoa-bowl.png" alt="light pink roasted salmon with cucumber and other greens ontop, laying upon quinoa in a bowl" class="food-primary">
    <p>This salmon recipe offers a quick and easy dinner, ready in just 20 minutes, and is perfect for those who love varied textures. The salmon is roasted at a lower temperature, ensuring it turns out tender and buttery.</p>
    <p>The meal is built on a base of quinoa, topped with fresh arugula, thin cucumber slices, and a creamy homemade dill and yogurt dressing. Don't let "homemade" deter you—this dressing is incredibly simple to make, blending in seconds, especially with a mini food processor.</p>
    <p>As a bonus, cooking extra quinoa while preparing this dish provides a convenient and healthy option for lunches throughout the week. For another great quinoa idea, try their watermelon quinoa salad.</p>
