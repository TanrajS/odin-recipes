        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 oz. smoked sausage (such as andouille or kielbasa), sliced 1/4" thick</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch Tuscan kale, thick stems and ribs removed, chopped</li>
        <li>3 oil-packed anchovy fillets, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. fresh chopped sage or 1 tsp. dried sage</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. fresh chopped thyme or 1 tsp. dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 (14-oz.) cans cannellini beans, 1 drained, rinsed</li>
        <li>1/2 (5.2-oz.) block Boursin cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 375Â°. In a medium bowl, toss bread cubes, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, and a pinch of black pepper until coated. Transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Bake bread, tossing halfway through, until golden and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 Tbsp. oil; swirl pan to coat. Add sausage in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until starting to brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Cook, turning pieces, until starting to brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer sausage to a plate.</li>
        <li>Step 4: In same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 Tbsp. oil. Add shallots; season with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add kale and cook, stirring frequently, until just starting to wilt, about 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Push kale to make a small space in the center of skillet and add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Add anchovies (if using), garlic, sage, and thyme. Cook, keeping kale separate, until garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add broth to deglaze pan and stir everything to combine.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Add beans, including liquid from 1 can. Bring to a simmer and cook, mashing a few beans, until sauce is thickened and warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 7: Stir in Boursin until melted. Return sausage to skillet and stir to combine; season with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>Step 8: Divide bean mixture among bowls. Top with croutons.</li>
    </ol>
