        <li>Step 3: Stir in cream, fenugreek (if using), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Step 4: Divide rice among bowls or plates. Season chickpeas with salt, if needed, then top with cilantro. Spoon chickpeas over rice.</li>
